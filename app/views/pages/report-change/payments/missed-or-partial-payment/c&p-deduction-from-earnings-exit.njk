      <p class="govuk-body">We sent a deduction from earnings order (DEO) on 12 August 2022 to the other parent's employer. A DEO is a way of collecting child maintenance directly from the other parent's earnings or pension.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The employer must deduct the amount of child maintenance stated on the DEO from the other parent's net earnings or their pension and pay it to the Child Maintenance Service. This will include any arrears repayments that are due.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to contact us as we are working with the employer to make sure you receive your payments as soon as possible.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If the employer doesn't take the deductions and they don't have a good reason, we can take them to court and the court can fine them.</p>
