      <p class="govuk-body">You should have paid Â£300 for child maintenance for Robin between 1 Jan 2024 and 30 June 2024.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The other parent has told us they did not receive their scheduled payments. This
        could mean they did not receive the full amount, or received it at least three days
        after it was due.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">They have asked to use the Collect and Pay service. If we approve their request, we will:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
        <li>arrange to collect and pass on payments based on when you are paid your wages, pension or benefits</li>
        <li>take action to recover the amount of unpaid child maintenance</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Collect and pay fees</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You have to pay a fee each time you make or receive a child maintenance payment
        through the Child Maintenance Service. The fee is:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
        <li>20% for paying parents, added to every payment</li>
        <li>4% for receiving parents, taken off every payment</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Action required by 1 October 2024 </h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can either confirm the information the other parent has given us or provide
        details of payments you believe are correct. We will then decide if we approve their
        request to use the Collect and Pay service.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You may need to refer to bank statements or have them at hand during this process.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You must submit your response, and any evidence, by 1 October 2024 or
        your case may change to Collect and Pay automatically.</p>
